 * This Abstract class provides a schema that all players
 * adhere to. They need a nextMove() method which they can
 * determine. The thought process for doing this is to provide
 * multiple game play modes. Right now this allows for a 
 * Sudoku solver and also a single player style. In the future
 * it could also provide a helper player which could provide 
 * hints if the user gets stuck.
